This repository contains player performance reports based on my personal observational analysis. Each report evaluates players across tactical, technical, physical, and psychological areas, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and overall role execution.

The aim is to simulate professional scouting work, presenting data and analysis in a format useful for coaches, scouts, and recruitment teams. Through this work, I aim to showcase my expertise and passion for football analysis, continuing to develop my skills until I land a role at a professional football club.

Please note that some of these reports are based on personal analysis, as detailed player statistics are not always available. The purpose of this repository is to build a growing collection of performance reports, develop my analytical skills, and provide reference material for football performance evaluation.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome, especially constructive critique, as they help improve the quality and depth of future reports.
